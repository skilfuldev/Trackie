  about:
    "Seat number: 4\nBirthday: November 16, 1988\nBlood type: AB\nHair: Violet\nEyes: Violet\nLikes: Reading\nDislikes: Studying at school\nClubs: Children's Literature Research Society, Philosophy Research Society, Library Expedition Club\n\nYue is Nodoka's best friend, and is often seen around both her and Haruna. She's short and at times has a blunt way of speaking to people, but is generally a friendly person. She likes to read but (ironically) doesn't like to study, and is one of the Baka Rangers (a name for the 5 worst students in Negi's class). When she finds out that Negi is a mage she gets excited about learning magic herself.\n\nAt first she shows no romantic interest in Negi, but as time goes by she finds herself developing a crush on him. However she doesn't want to hurt Nodoka, so she tries to keep it bottled up as much as she can. She's supportive of Nodoka and wishes her the best of luck when it comes to her and Negi's relationship.\n\nYue became the 5th person in Negi's class to make a pactio with him, following Asuna, Nodoka, Setsuna, and Konoka.",
